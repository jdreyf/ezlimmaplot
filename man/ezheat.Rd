\arguments{
\item{object}{Matrix-like object with features (e.g. genes) as rows and samples as columns.}

\item{pheno.df}{Data frame with rows as samples and columns as phenotypes.}

\item{labrows}{Labels for rows, e.g. gene symbols. This can be of length 1 (in which case it is recycled),
of length \code{nrow(object)}.}

\item{labcols}{Labels for columns. This can be of length 1 (in which case it is recycled),
of length \code{ncol(object)}.}

\item{main}{Main title of plot.}

\item{name}{Name of file to create. Set to \code{NA} to plot to screen instead of to file.}

\item{sc}{Row scaling. Should rows be centered ('ctr'), z-scored ('z'), or neither ('none').}

\item{clip}{Values with magnitude > \code{clip} are reset to value \code{clip}. If given, must be > 0.}

\item{color.v}{Color palette for heatmap. If \code{NULL}, it's set to
\code{colorRampPalette(rev(brewer.pal(n=9, name='RdYlBu')))(50)}.}

\item{unique.rows}{Logical; remove duplicated row labels to make rows unique?}

\item{only.labrows}{Logical; only include rows where \code{labrows} aren't missing
(missing is defined by \code{na.lab})?}

\item{ntop}{Scalar number of rows to include.}

\item{stat.tab}{Matrix-like object with statistics, such as p-values, per column, used to add "*". If given, its
dimensions should match \code{object} and it cannot have \code{NA}s.}

\item{cutoff}{Cutoff such that elements with \code{stats.tab < cutoff} show asterisk if \code{stats.tab} and
\code{cutoff} are not \code{NULL}.}

\item{reorder_rows}{Logical; should rows be reordered with hierarchical clustering?}

\item{reorder_cols}{Logical; should columns be reordered with hierarchical clustering?}

\item{gaps_row}{vector of row indices after which to insert gaps.}

\item{gaps_col}{vector of column indices after which to insert gaps.}

\item{annotation_row}{data frame that specifies the annotations shown on left
 side of the heatmap. Each row defines the features for a specific row. The 
rows in the data and in the annotation are matched using corresponding row
 names. Note that color schemes takes into account if variable is continuous
 or discrete.}

\item{annotation_colors}{list for specifying annotation_row and annotation_col track colors manually.
It is possible to define the colors for only some of the features. See \code{\link[pheatmap]{pheatmap}} examples.}

\item{angle_col}{angle of the column labels, right now one can choose only from few 
predefined options (0, 45, 90, 270 and 315)}

\item{fontsize_row}{Font size for row labels.}

\item{fontsize_col}{Font size for column labels.}

\item{na.lab}{Character vector of labels in \code{lab.col} to treat as missing, in addition to \code{NA}.}

\item{plot}{Logical; should plot be generated?}

\item{width}{Manual option for determining the output file width in inches.}

\item{height}{Manual option for determining the output file height in inches.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; print pruning messages to console?}
}
\value{
A list with element \code{mat} of the matrix of values plotted, and if \code{plot=TRUE} element
\code{gtable}, containing the \code{gtable} object returned by \code{\link[pheatmap]{pheatmap}}.
}
\description{
Draw heatmap using \pkg{pheatmap} package.
}
\details{
\code{main} is modified to describe data transformations.

If the data after scaling and clipping (if they are used) has positive and negative values, the key is made
symmetric about zero.

\code{object} cannot have \code{NA}s.
